# AddSearch for WordPress

AddSearch is an instant search for your WordPress site. It is lightning fast, gives you full control over search results, and works on all devices.

## Description

AddSearch is a hosted search for your WordPress site that gives you accurate results instantly. And when we say instant, we mean that literally: you get results with just one key press. We have worked hard to ensure that AddSearch is the fastest search available anywhere.

The main benefits of AddSearch over the standard WordPress search, and other search solutions, are:

1. **Lightning fast**. With AddSearch you get results immediately after just one keypress. The results appear in a layer on top of the page, which you can scroll infinitely. It's a dramatically better user experience than with any other solution.

2. **Easy installation**. Installing the plugin takes minutes: you just copy one line of text, and you're done. There's no fiddling with templates, maintenance or hassle of any kind. 

3. **Mobile support**. AddSearch's UI adapts to any device, including desktops, tablets and phones. You don't need to do anything for full mobile support, even if your site isn't responsive or mobile.

4. **Results control**. You get to decide which pages and areas are more important than others. You also get full statistics, and can integrate your search analytics with Google Analytics.

AddSearch recrawls your site automatically, and automatically adds new content to the search. AddSearch is fully hosted and runs on highly scalable servers which ensure operation even on very high traffic sites.

AddSearch is free for sites up to 300 pages. For larger sites there are reasonable monthly or annual fees. See details at [www.addsearch.com/pricing](http://www.addsearch.com/pricing/)
